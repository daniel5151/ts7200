# ts7200

A high level emulator for the [TS-7200](https://www.embeddedarm.com/products/TS-7200) Single Board Computer, as used in CS 452 - Real Time Operating Systems at the University of Waterloo.

AKA: _choochoo_emu_ ðŸš‚

## Disclaimer

The primary purpose of this emulator is to enable rapid prototyping and development of the CS 452 kernel without having to literally _live_ in the Trains lab. That said, at the end of the day, you won't be marked on how well your kernel runs in this emulator, you'll be marked on how well your kernel runs on the actual hardware in the trains lab!

**We make no guarantees about the accuracy and/or stability of this emulator! Use it at your own risk!**

- Instruction timings and hardware access times are _waaay_ off, so any profiling/benchmarking performed in the emulator won't be representative of the real hardware whatsoever!
- Emulated UARTs are quiet forgiving when it comes to sending / receiving data!

## Getting Started

`ts7200` is written in Rust, and uses `cargo` for building / installation. If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

You can install `ts7200` to your `$PATH` by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

**We highly recommended redirecting the emulator's `stderr` to a file / tty!**

By default, the emulator puts `stdin` and `stdout` into "raw" mode, which ends up "breaking" `stderr`'s output. When `stderr` inevitably tries to output some text to the tty, it ends up "smearing" it across the terminal. This can be fixed by redirecting the process's `stderr` to a separate tty: `ts7200 ... 2> /dev/pts/X`.

## Emulator Enhancements

While the emulator isn't as accurate as real hardware, there are quite a few features the emulator has that real hardware _doesn't_ give you:

- GDB Debugging across context switches!
- Emulated devices emit `ContractViolation` errors if they are accessed "incorrectly," unlike real hardware, which will silently fail. Keep an eye on `stderr`!
    - e.g: Accessing Uninitialized RAM logs a warning to stderr
    - e.g: Trying to enable a timer without giving it an initial value throws a fatal error
- Instead of zeroing-out RAM, uninitialized RAM is set to the ASCII value corresponding to '-' (i.e: decimal 45, hex 0x2d). This makes it easier to spot uninitialized memory issues.

## Status

**NOTE:** This is a non-exhaustive list of the project's status. There are also a plethora of TODOs, FIXMEs, XXXs, and stubs littered throughout the codebase, which provide an informal overview of subtle bits of missing and/or flat out wrong functionality.

- Core features
    - [x] HLE boot (emulating CS 452's Redboot configuration)
        - [x] ELF file parsing
        - [x] Initializes devices / key memory locations with hardware-validated values
    - [x] Debugging with GDB
- Devices
    - [x] UARTs - _Implemented, but too forgiving!_
        - Real UART hardware can be quite finicky, _especially_ when interacting with the Marklin train controller. Things that work fine on the emulator may _not_ work on actual hardware!
        - [x] RX/TX Flags
        - [ ] CTS flag (_currently fixed to `1`!_)
        - [x] Important registers (for CS 452)
        - [x] Interrupts
    - [x] Timers - _Totally Accurate!_
        - [x] All Documented Register Functionality
        - [x] Interrupts
    - [x] VIC - _Mostly Accurate_
        - [x] Asserts and Clears Interrupts
        - [x] Correct daisy-chaining behavior
        - [x] Vectored Interrupt Support (_caution: not very well tested_)
        - [ ] Reading from the VectAddr register doesn't actually mask out interrupts until you write to it
        - [ ] Protection bit can be accessed from _any_ mode (not just privileged modes)
    - [x] System Controller (Syscon) - _Only the Important Parts_
        - _Note:_ Lot of stuff in the Syscon isn't relevant to CS 452, and will be left unimplemented
        - [x] Correct handling of SW Locked Registers
        - [x] Low Power Halt
        - [ ] Low Power Standby
        - [x] The two 32bit scratch registers (lmao)
    - [ ] RTC
    - [ ] Coprocessors
        - _Note:_ `arm7tdmi-rs` doesn't currently expose a configurable coprocessor interface. Instead, any coprocessor operations are simply logged, and treated as no-ops. Until `arm7tdmi-rs` adds support for custom coprocessors, the following devices cannot be emulated correctly:
        - [ ] MMU
        - [ ] Caches
        - [ ] MaverickCrunch Co-Processor (i.e: math coprocessor)

## Non-Goals

- LLE emulation of all TS-7200 hardware (e.g: to support "cold boots" directly into Redboot)
    - Most of the devices on the board aren't used by the CS 452 kernel, so emulating / stubbing them out just to get Redboot working isn't a great use of our time.
- Totally Accurate CPU performance
    - The emulated CPU runs as fast as the host system lets it, so performance will vary based on which machine you run the emulator on.
    - _Note:_ Timers are implemented using the system clock, and will do the Right Thing no matter how fast the host system is.
- Train emulation
    - You mean you want me to write a physics simulator for virtual trains? Hahahaha, yeah... no.
    - _Update:_ Looks like someone else was crazy enough to actually attempt doing this! Check out the [MarklinSim](https://github.com/Martin1994/MarklinSim) project!
